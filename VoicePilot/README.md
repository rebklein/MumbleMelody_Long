  <h2>Welcome to our Longitudinal Study on Stuttering</h2>
  <p>Thank you very much for participating in our study. We are studying how changing the way one hears one’s own voice affects speech fluency in people who stutter.

    <h3>Background Information</h3>
    <p>Stuttering is common, and affects ~1% of the population worldwide. This condition is characterized by involuntary repetitions, blockages, and prolongations of sound during speaking. From prior studies, we know that fluency can be improved by playing back one’s own voice fractions of a second after it is spoken -- this is known as “delayed auditory feedback”. Altering the pitch of one’s own voice - making it sound lower or higher - produces a similar, fluency-evoking effect. There are commercially-available technologies that take advantage of these observations by continuously playing a recording into the ear. These systems, however, are expensive, often do not work long term, and cannot be easily personalized. We are interested in developping an approach that is more user-friendly and effective in the long term.

    <h3>About our Study</h3>
    <p>Throughout this study you will be asked to use an iPhone app every day for 30 minutes while talking. No voice data will be collected during those daily sessions. We only ask you to log when you are using the app and on which setting. Once a week, you will have a 30min testing session using both the app and a platform on your computer browser. During those sessions, your voice will be recorded for later analysis of your fluency.

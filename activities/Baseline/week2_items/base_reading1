    "question": "John planted a seed in his garden. He dug into the sod while humming a tune from the radio. The song was a tad off key, but John persisted because he was in a keyed up frame of mind from the long work week. As he worked, Johnâ€™s buddy Todd walked by. Todd was thought to be somewhat of a cad by most, but was known for his stories. He spun a tale about an eccentric woman who sat on her stoop every night and fed a cod and a shad to the pigeons that cooed from above.",

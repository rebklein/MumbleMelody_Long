    "question": "John and I went to the farm in June. The sun shone all day, and wind waved the grass in wide fields that ran by the road. Most birds had left on their trek south, but old friends were there to greet us. Piles of wood had been stacked by the door, left there by the man who lives twelve miles down the road. The stove would not last till dawn on what he had cut, so I went and chopped more till the sun set.",
